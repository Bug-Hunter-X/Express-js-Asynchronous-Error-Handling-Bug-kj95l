# Express.js Asynchronous Error Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: improper handling of errors thrown during asynchronous operations.  The bug results in the application failing silently, making debugging difficult.

## Bug Description

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js application with a route that performs an asynchronous operation.  If the operation fails, the error is caught, but the response to the client is not handled appropriately. This leads to an incomplete response, causing problems for the user.  The error is only logged to the console, which might be missed in production environments.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version. The proper way to handle errors within Express.js middleware, is to use the `next()` function to pass the error to the application's error-handling middleware. This makes the application more robust and easier to debug.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `node bug.js` to run the buggy application. Make multiple requests to observe the inconsistent responses.
5. Run `node bugSolution.js` to run the fixed application, and observe the consistent error handling.
